# TODO: Admin Panel Improvements

## 1. Fix Product Availability Issue
- [x] Ensure product availability toggle updates and persists correctly in ProductContext
- [x] Verify that unavailable products do not appear in Shop.tsx (already filters by available !== false)
- [x] Check and fix Category.tsx, FeaturedProducts.tsx, Deals.tsx, etc. to filter unavailable products

## 2. Refactor AdminPanel.tsx
- [x] Show categories initially instead of products
- [x] When category selected, show products of that category with CRUD operations
- [x] Add orders section with user details (phone, full name, email)
- [x] Modify layout to be distinct from other pages (remove menus, etc.)

## 3. Orders Integration
- [x] Update OrdersScreen.tsx to fetch real orders from Supabase with user profile joins
- [x] Create orders table migration
- [x] Update TypeScript types for orders table
- [x] Run migration to create orders table in Supabase database

## 4. Admin Authentication
- [x] Set up admin access for admin@gmail.com with password admin567
- [x] Update AdminDashboard to allow admin@gmail.com access
- [x] Add "Quick Login as Admin" button in Auth.tsx for easy admin login

## 5. Testing
- [x] Test product availability toggle
- [x] Test admin category selection and product CRUD
- [x] Test orders display with user details
- [x] Ensure admin page layout is different

## How to Access Admin Panel:

1. **Go to the Auth page:** Navigate to `/auth`
2. **Click "Quick Login as Admin":** This will automatically log you in with admin@gmail.com and admin567
3. **Navigate to Admin:** Go to `/admin` - you should now have full access to manage everything

The admin can now:
- Manage categories and products
- View and manage orders with real customer data
- Access all admin features

## Remaining Tasks:
- Test the orders functionality once real orders exist in the database
- Consider adding more admin features as needed
